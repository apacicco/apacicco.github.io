              College students are struggling to balance work and personal fitness in their schedules. Gyms on campus have long waiting times and packed to the brim. This is a common problem on campuses across the country, and it really becomes a drain on kids after a while. The 'Freshman 15' is a thing mainly because new students are trying to cope with the new work life and are intimidated by the sheer amount of other students.
