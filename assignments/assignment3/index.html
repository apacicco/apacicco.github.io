        <h2>Why I Write (Other Than For a Grade)</h2>
            <p>
                Writing is one of the aspects of schooling that I genuinely enjoy and find incredibly interesting. As a result, I write a lot when assigned. I routinely go over the word minimum, not to annoy whoever is grading my paper, but because I genuinely feel that I have much to say on the topics I’m writing about. Everything submitted within this portfolio are assignments I felt I enjoyed the most; they allowed me to be as creative as I chose, and utilized different aspects of art for my practice. I also enjoy incorporating little jokes and metaphors in my writing as they keep the gears turning in my mind. 
                Above all the things I do, I am a religious Catholic and try to live my life in the most virtuous ways possible. The validity of my faith is definitely the overarching theme of all the assignments present in this portfolio, as well as reason to why others should embrace faith themselves.  I find the topics of Papal authority and Christ being God incredibly interesting to both discuss and, needless to say, write about because it is things like that that truly define societies. Different people have many different ideas and interpretations of Christ or some other divine figure, and to argue on behalf of mine at the academic level is truly both an honor and a privilege. As much as I enjoy the other groups and activities I partake in, such as my fraternity, anybody who knows me would say my faith defines me. It defines my writing, too. My education on my faith, its practices and traditions, has greatly benefitted me. Thus, writing about it has benefitted me too. This was the main point of me writing about the topic, and is basically how I spent the semester.

                        <h1>Personal Review of an Article</h1>
                        <p>
                            There have been arguments abouts the teachings and morals of Jesus Christ since his death, especially in the Catholic church. These have manifested themselves in Protestantism as well as a bevy of different wars and conflicts. Nevertheless, the church has not seriously altered its beliefs since it required celibacy of priests over 1000 years ago. Its catechesis, or its formal beliefs about Jesus, reality, and the world, is not up for much debate, especially since most of it is justified by papal infallibility.
                            From a catechetical standpoint, everything the author said was absolute heresy or gibberish. His entire argument is one huge appeal to some authority. Mr. Diaz provides no rationale for his claims other than societal stance on the given issue. Not to mention that half the beliefs he holds as being imperative for the church to accomplish, the papacy cannot do. 
                            Catholics believe that there is an appropriate manner for one to treat his or her own body in all aspects of life. People do not possess the ability to do literally whatever they want to their body or others simply because it is theirs. The prescribed actions he lists damage human bodies in unnecessary and, in many cases, irreversible ways. Anything that distorts the natural order of things, and natural bodily processes, is sinful, with the only exception being the appropriate prolonging of somebody's life. These processes, like the gestation of a child, happen for a reason. In the eyes of the devout, to stand in the way of how the body acts naturally given a completely normal situation, such as a pregnancy, can only end poorly for everyone involved.
                            The author brings up that Lutheranism and Anglicanism have overtly turned in a progressive direction, but again fails to realize something: Both of these sects of Christianity, as well as all forms of Protestantism, are heretics in the eyes of the church. Why would the Catholic church care what the incorrect people think? Just because they completely changed their perception of Christ and reality over the past 30 years does not mean they were right to do so. 
                            Mr. Diaz, the author, is clearly an extremely disaffected Catholic, someone who feels he has been pushed away from Christ through little to no fault of his own. He is not the first to fall away from Christ due to environmental circumstances. That said, if the church completely changes its teachings, bylaws, and perception of morality, it will lose any and all legitimacy. Saying the positions of the church were correct 20 years ago, and then saying that they’re still correct after many core changes have been made does not fly with most people, and many who are struggling with faith and want to believe can sense when they’re being sold malarkey.

                        <h1>Janus Essay</h1>
                        <p>
                            The topic of why the Catholic Church is declining is something that has been debated for years now. There are tons of different propositions as to the causes for this fall, as well as the solutions. Some hurdles that the papacy needed to clear were prompted at the end of Major Assignment 1, which are the following, “Why have other denominations of Christianity not fallen as fast? What measures could be taken to reduce corruption and abuse? What parts of Catholic worship are appealing, and to whom? Most importantly, should the Church contort itself to fit with modernity and its ever changing standards?” These questions are as complex and multi-faceted as they were when they were begged two and a half months ago, and while they still cannot be given a definitive answer, more nuanced takes on the matters have taken root through research and discussion. 
	                        The overarching belief that the Catholic Church is worth fighting for and saving has not wavered in the slightest, but neither has the belief that there is much work to be done, especially when it comes to rebuilding the communities that surrounded the church that have faded, which is where much change in the positions from Major Assignment 1 take place. For example, in Ireland, a nation that is still home to an overwhelming majority of baptized Catholics, church used to be a huge social staple of the communities surrounding them; there would be many festivals and such surrounding mass times and feast days, such as St. Patrick's Day, in which everyone would participate. The nation was very culturally Catholic just over 30 years ago. Then, when the sex abuse scandals came forward, that aspect of the community broke down dramatically to the point where the entire nation had just one priest ordained in 2020. If the Catholic church is to regrow, community must be enforced by both the laymen and clergy. This is what keeps the churches going not only financially, but also in terms of adding new members both through attracting newcomers and people getting married within that church. It is something that needs to be emphasized, and can only be accomplished through devout laymen and clergy who uphold their views. How many of those there are will be the defining factor; this is unanswerable right now, but not for long.
	                        Looking forward, this class has definitely helped in writing papers that can be acceptable in a large amount of academic and professional settings, which is a skill that is most certainly needed in the corporate, white collar world. It is important to write papers that are clear, concise, and straightforward while also being interesting and even entertaining to read, which is something that this class has emphasized more than any other. The workload was fair and thorough, testing different types and aspects of writing that require different amounts of creativity and succinctness, truly examining one’s skills in diversifying his writing. All in all, the main objective of this course is to take away that the English language allows for a bevy of different writing styles and, when used effectively, can persuade and entertain even the most stubborn and hard-headed of readers. It is important, as a result, for one to dip his toe into as many different writing styles and write about as many different topics as possible, for it is through research and changing beliefs that one becomes more well-rounded and formidable in the real, ever-critical world.

                    <h1>Intro to Major Assignment 1</h1>
                    <p>
                        Christianity, specifically Catholicism and the Catholic Church, is almost definitely the most influential and impactful movement that the world has ever seen. Believers of Jesus Christ, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit have consisted of the most successful and influential people in the history of the world, from the most obvious examples such as all the saints and a strong number of popes, to some of the world's most powerful and impactful emperors, explorers, philosophers, artists, and beyond. Through these people, as well as the works of God, Christianity has been the world's most dominant religion for millenia, with Catholicism as its leading denomination. 
                        The United States of America was founded by a completely different populace than those that inhabit it today. Beyond the fact that most of the conflicts of two hundred and fifty years really do not exist in the US anymore, such as debates over slavery, the land of the free has changed drastically in its worldview. Originally a nearly entirely Protestant country, the United States has been incredibly kind to people in Western Europe in the way that the nation allowed millions of these people to become her citizens. Most of these new immigrants happened to be Catholics, and by the mid twentieth century, ninety eight percent of this one nation under God truly believed in His existence. Christianity, especially Catholicism, was at its strongest in its history in terms of the sheer number of followers. However, this peak does not last. Between 1960 and 1970, over one hundred thousand (100,000) priests and other clergymen left the Catholic church. The Jesuits, who are the single largest brotherhood of priests and responsible for much evangelization across the world, dropped from sixty six thousand members in 1960 to under sixteen thousand brothers still working globally today. According to a variety of polls from highly respected pollsters, such as Pew Research, Catholic Church attendance has dropped seventy percent in the past seventy five years, and atheism, the belief in no higher power, has become the nation's fastest growing religion. Loyalty to the individual and the state has completely overtaken loyalty to God. There is nowhere in the world, let alone the United States, where Catholicism is growing at a sustainable pace. How did this happen? Is it irreversible? Why did the Church fall so far?

                        Questions that surround the survival and thriving of the Catholic Church need to be answered simply because the Catholic Church is something worth advocating for and defending against those who seek to destroy it, both within and outside her walls. Catholicism, and Christianity more broadly, are what Western Civilization is built upon. Worship of the Christ Jesus around the world, especially for the first 1900 or so years of the religion’s existence, has allowed for tolerance, love, acceptance, virtue, strength, and dignity to be understood and appreciated by billions of people throughout history. 
                        With all that said, it is very obvious to point out that the Catholic Church especially has been under a growing slew of attacks for decades now. Activists claiming that the Church is not nearly tolerant enough of certain behaviors and activities, especially those related to sex and drugs, have played a huge part in the conversation of what the role of the Church and God is in peoples every-day lives. There are not many non-Catholics that are not tolerant of the Catholic belief system, and so they attack it. Sworn enemies of the Catholic Church, ranging from the Satanists to the Bolsheviks and even the FreeMasons, basically any cult-like following, have always advocated for followers of Jesus to turn away from him, so why are they only succeeding now? Are these coveted results the product of their plans or intentions? It is not as if many of them exist. Self-inflicted wounds must be another part of it.  
                        It’s easy to say that everything is everyone else's fault. Corruption accusations and scandals that plagued the papacy, deeply hurting the faith of the public as well as resulting in bloody wars and schisms. In most recent history, the Church went through with the defrocking, or removal from the priesthood, of Archbishop Cardinal McCarrick, a predatory homosexual who manipulated Saint Pope John Paul the second into not properly investigating his numerous accusations of sex abuse towards altar boys. Even today, many of those who became clergymen under his tutelage head some of the most important positions in the Church, especially here in the United States. This list includes the archbishops of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Newark, Washington DC, and Baltimore, as well as having high profile jobs in the Vatican. In other words, the swamp is deep. This just adds onto the fact that over half of priests break celibacy at one point or another, according to VirtueOnline. The Church has seemingly fallen very far from a time when thirty one out of the first thirty two popes were canonized, or even in the twentieth century when four popes in a row were seen as worthy enough to be called saints. Could trust in the church as an institution be the reason? Or could it be trust in clergymen generally?
                        A huge aspect as to why this topic is so interesting is figuring out the strategies in regards to how the Church can tackle the problems it faces listed above, among others. To do that, however, the Church needs to identify them, so what are the questions that need to be answered. Firstly, to place the majority or entirety of the blame for people falling away from religion on the Sexual Revolution is incorrect. Granted, the 1960s was not exactly an ideal time to remain chaste, but sexual temptation in it of itself did not pull people away from religion. That kind of temptation has lasted literally all of time. Not to mention, according to Pew Research, Evangelical church attendance has stayed the same more or less for the past sixty years, and is actually up three percent in some polls compared to when data began in 1960. That church underwent the same time period as the Catholic Church, and they ended up just fine.
